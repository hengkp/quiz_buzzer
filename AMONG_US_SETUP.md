### Socket.IO Events

The system uses real-time WebSocket communication for:
- Team updates (names, colors, scores)
- Timer synchronization
- Buzzer presses
- Action card usage
- Question set progression
- Live logging

### Arduino Integration

Supports ESP32/Arduino with:
- 6 team buzzer inputs (GPIO pins: D4, D5, D13, D14, D21, D22)
