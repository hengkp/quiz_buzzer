# Required Arduino Libraries

## Core Libraries for ESP32-C Node32s Quiz Buzzer

### Board Support
- **ESP32 Arduino Core** - Board definitions for ESP32-C boards
  - **Version Compatibility**: v2.0.0 to v3.x supported
  - **Important**: Core 3.x has updated LEDC API (see notes below)

## Installation Instructions

### Board Support Installation
1. File → Preferences
2. Additional Boards Manager URLs: 
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
   ```
3. Tools → Board → Boards Manager
4. Search "ESP32"
5. Install "esp32 by Espressif Systems"

### Board Selection
1. Tools → Board → ESP32 Arduino
2. Select "ESP32C3 Dev Module" or similar ESP32-C variant
3. Set appropriate port and upload speed

### Library Versions (Tested)
- ESP32 Arduino Core: v2.0.0 or later
- ESP32 Arduino Core: v3.x (requires LEDC API updates)

## ESP32 Arduino Core 3.x Compatibility

### LEDC API Changes in Core 3.x
If you get compilation errors like:
```
error: 'ledcSetup' was not declared in this scope
error: 'ledcAttachPin' was not declared in this scope
```

**Solution**: Update your code from Core 2.x to Core 3.x API:

#### Old API (Core 2.x):
```cpp
ledcSetup(channel, frequency, resolution);
ledcAttachPin(pin, channel);
ledcWrite(channel, duty);
```

#### New API (Core 3.x):
```cpp
ledcAttach(pin, frequency, resolution);  // Combined function
ledcWrite(pin, duty);                    // Write to pin instead of channel
```

### Project Files Updated
- ✅ `quiz_buzzer.ino` - Updated for Core 3.x compatibility
- ✅ `quiz_2teams.ino` - No PWM usage, works with all versions

## Notes
- No additional libraries required for basic buzzer functionality
- System uses only built-in GPIO and Serial communication
- PWM functionality (buzzers/tones) uses LEDC API
- Web interface handles all display functionality 

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Compilation Errors
- **"ledcSetup not declared"**: Update to Core 3.x API (see above)
- **Board not found**: Install ESP32 board support package
- **Upload fails**: Try different baud rate or hold BOOT button

### Hardware Issues  
- **No serial output**: Check baud rate (115200)
- **Connection issues**: Use Chrome/Edge for Web Serial API
- **GPIO conflicts**: Use safe pins listed in code comments
