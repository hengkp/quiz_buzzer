# High School Quiz Bowl Format & Rules

## 1. Competition Overview
A fast-paced, buzzer-driven quiz tournament for six high school teams (3 members each). Questions cover Biology, Physics, Chemistry, General Knowledge, and Everyday Technology. Game length is capped at 1 hour.

## 2. Match Structure
- **Teams & Buzzers**  
  Team A–Team F, each with one buzzer.

- **Question Sets**  
  8 themed sets (plus 2 backup sets). Each set has 4 questions:  
  1. **Toss-Up (Q1):** Open buzzer; any team may buzz.  
  2. **Follow-Ups (Q2–Q4):** Only the toss-up winner may answer.

- **Time Limit**  
  15 seconds to answer after buzzing.

## 3. Scoring Rules
- **Toss-Up (Q1):**  
  - Correct: **+1** point  
  - Incorrect: **–1** point; barred from further buzzes on that toss-up

- **Follow-Ups (Q2–Q4):**  
  - Base: **+1** point each  
  - Wrong: **0** points; ends that team’s turn for the set

## 4. Challenge Multiplier
After a correct Q1, the winning team may choose:
- **No Challenge:** Q2–Q4 worth +1; no penalty for wrong.
- **×2 Challenge:** Q2–Q4 worth +2; first wrong = –2 and ends set.

## 5. Action Cards
Each team has three one-time Action Cards. To use, buzz in on Q1 and before answering, declare **Answer Normally** or play one card.

### 5.1 Devil Card
- **When to Play:** After your buzz, before toss-up is read  
- **Effect:** Force one opponent to answer Q1.  
  - If they fail (–1), you gain **+2**.  
  - If they succeed, they proceed to follow-ups normally; you get **0**.

### 5.2 Angel Card
- **When to Play:**  
  - After your buzz, before toss-up is read, **or**  
  - After winning Q1, before follow-ups  

- **Effects:**  
  1. **Before Toss-Up:**  
     - Correct: **+1**  
     - Wrong: **0** (no –1 penalty)  

  2. **After Winning Q1 (with Challenge Multiplier):**  
     - Follow-ups Q2–Q4 are risk-free.  
     - Correct: **+2** each  
     - Wrong: **0** (no –1 penalty)

## 6. Game End Conditions
1. **Threshold Rule:** Ends immediately if three teams exceed 10 points.  
2. **Full-Sets Rule:** If threshold isn’t met, play all 8 valid sets; final standings by total points.

## 7. Example Card Usage
- **Set Theme: World History**  
  - Team C buzzes first, plays Devil Card on Team E.  
  - Team E fails Q1: –1 to E, +2 to C.

- **Set 4:** Team B wins Q1, uses Angel Card, answers wrong: 0 penalty.

- **Set 7:** Team A wins Q1, opts for ×3 Challenge. Answers Q2–Q4 all correctly:  
  - Earns 1 (Q1) + (3 + 3 + 3) for Q2–Q4 = **10** points total.

## 8. Strategy & Fairness
- Cards are single-use per team; timing is crucial.  
- Devil and Angel Cards are risk-management tools.  
- A team targeted by a Devil Card cannot be targeted again in the same match.  
- Format balances knowledge, speed, and tactics to decide the winner.
