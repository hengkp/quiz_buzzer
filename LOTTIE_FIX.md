# Lottie Animation Fix

## Problem
The original `.lottie` files were causing errors because they are compressed ZIP archives containing JSON data, not standard Lottie JSON files. The standard Lottie player expects JSON format directly.

## Error Messages
```
lottie.js:1157 Uncaught InvalidStateError: Failed to read the 'responseText' property from 'XMLHttpRequest': The value is only accessible if the object's 'responseType' is '' or 'text' (was 'json').
```

## Solution
1. **Converted .lottie files to .json format**:
   - `.lottie` files are actually ZIP archives containing JSON animation data
   - Extracted the JSON content from each `.lottie` file
   - Created corresponding `.json` files for standard Lottie player compatibility

2. **Updated all file references**:
   - Changed all `src="*.lottie"` to `src="*.json"` in HTML files
   - Updated JavaScript animation switching code to use `.json` extensions

## Files Converted
- `Among Us - Idle.lottie` → `Among Us - Idle.json`
- `Among Us - Asks.lottie` → `Among Us - Asks.json`
- `Among Us - Nods.lottie` → `Among Us - Nods.json`
- `Among Us - Fears.lottie` → `Among Us - Fears.json`
- `Among Us - Run.lottie` → `Among Us - Run.json`
- `Among Us - Beats with fist.lottie` → `Among Us - Beats with fist.json`
- `Among Us - Eating chocolate.lottie` → `Among Us - Eating chocolate.json`
- `Among Us - Nods with headphones.lottie` → `Among Us - Nods with headphones.json`
- `Among Us - Turns around to look.lottie` → `Among Us - Turns around to look.json`
- `Among Us - Wipes off sweat.lottie` → `Among Us - Wipes off sweat.json`

## Browser Extension Error Fix
Also added error suppression for Chrome extension context errors:
```javascript
window.addEventListener('error', function(e) {
    if (e.message && e.message.includes('Extension context invalidated')) {
        e.preventDefault();
        return false;
    }
});
```

## Result
✅ Lottie animations now load correctly without errors
✅ Among Us characters animate properly on the display
✅ Console errors are suppressed
✅ Full functionality restored

## Technical Details
The conversion process:
1. Unzipped each `.lottie` file
2. Extracted the JSON animation data from the `animations/` folder inside
3. Saved as standard `.json` files
4. Updated all references in the codebase

This maintains full compatibility with the standard Lottie player while preserving all animation functionality.
